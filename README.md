# stockControlSystem
This is a stock control program, which I had created in C# as a small university project.

The user can view an already exist array of product types and an already existing sorted list of products as keys and product types as values used in the key/value pair.
The user can also add a new item with an already existing product type. which will be appended as a key and value pair inside of the sorted list.
